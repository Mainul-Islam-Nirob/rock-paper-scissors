The Odin Project - Rock Paper Scissor Solution

Solution for the [PROJECT: Rock Paper Scissors](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/rock-paper-scissors) from the [Javascript Basics](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations#javascript-basics) part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/).

## My process
Hello, this is my 2nd project here in The Odin Project. It's a simple Rock Paper Scissors game.
the design idea is taken from the Frontend Mentors Rock-Paper-Scissors exercise design. Although the design is not exactly the same as Frontend Mentors' design. I will make this project's design the same as the frontend mentors' design later.
